# @erickmerchant/css

Combines the benefits of BEM and utility classes.

This project's goal is to allow a good authoring experience while shipping highly optimized atomic css. The CLI takes a single JS module entry point, and then outputs a single CSS file and a generated JS module file that has a map of keys to the generated class names in the CSS file.
